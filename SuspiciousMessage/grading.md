Answer:

Hey Henry,
I just finished the internal reports for you and double-checked the math.  Our clients will be very happy with out returns for this quarter.  Also, you'll receive a parcel in the mail within the week.  Tell your wife and daughters hi for me and make sure to give them a share of my present to you.  Thanks a ton!
