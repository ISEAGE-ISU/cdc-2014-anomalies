Social Engineering Attack
-------
A recent social engineering attack asked all users to send their passwords to a foreign email address.  Because we have no idea how many users actually did this, we must reset all passwords for security.  New passwords are found in IScorE.  You must submit this anomaly (even with a blank message) to receive points for this anomaly.  This anomaly is required.
