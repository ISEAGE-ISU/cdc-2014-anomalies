Add Website Capabiltiy

Robert Commit and the other lawyers would like the capability to add new cases through the web interface rather than having to ask Patrick Van Standt to do it for them.  The new feature should (1) create a folder on the FTP server for the case files that is linked to the web interface like the other cases (2) Add the people who need to have access to the case files.  Submit Green Team documentation on how to use this feature.
