New Employees
--------
Due to a large increase in business, we have hired another lawyer and a paralegal to assist with the Tax Evasion case.  In addition, we have hired another system administrator to help with managing our servers.  Below are their names and usernames.  Their passwords can be found on IScorE under Team Specific Info.  Chris Atkinson is in training and therefore needs SSH to all boxes that pstandt has access to but does not need to have sudo and other administrative rights.
